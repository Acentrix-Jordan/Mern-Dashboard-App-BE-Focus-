#React MERN Dashboard App

This project is from a code along on youtube by EdRoh.

For this particular project we will be building a full stack application with a focus on the backend technology.

With me being a Front-End Developer, I would really to expand my knowledge and get a basic understanding of what is happening on the backend so I can talk to the BEE's and be more specific. Or maybe even try and become a Full Stack Engineer. Who knows?

I have not just blindly followed this tutorial and have rewatched many sections to truely understand is happening. 

You will see there is a lot of comments on the build. This is for my own knowledge and so I can reference the code in future.
